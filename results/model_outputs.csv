232,"then i began to listen to what the welloff were saying about the poor now  the war had just ended, and the language was much the same as it had been before the first reform act.  a small minority thought that england was really theirs, they had made it, they owned it.  the rest, the wage earners, were foreigners, outsiders intent on wrecking it all.

245,"i know, i know!  gentlemen, let me introduce you to one of our most talented contributors to the cold war.  james penfield.  he wrote the opening chapter, on 'the berlin airlift'.  one of the best chapters in the book.
",you have been here to build . soon ?
246,"would you like a dessert...i am having one.
",i came up .
247,"yes...you are not a socialist then?
",what ?
248,"personally james, i am very excited by this new arrangement we have. it gives us direct access to literally hundreds of american collages.  twentieth century history is a growth area over there, don't ask me why.  your readership will be first and second year american collage students...
","you are a fine crazy , i can have some things in to mark !"
249,"james... i cannot begin to tell you how pleased we all are.  congratulations, and i really mean it.

","i know , dad ."
252,"can i give you a lift?
",sure .
253,"what did you think of that wadja film?
",me ?
254,"everyone describes the same process. at first it is exciting.  you are at the centre of the world.  as soon as anything happens, you are the first to know about it.  and there are deadlines a dozen times a day, even more, and that is intimidating and exciting.  then you get the hang of it and the excitement wears off.  your a clerk in a rather dowdy office.  there's none of the glamour of television, or the penetration of serious journalism.  you are a processor of semiofficial news.  some people leave at this stage.  then, if you hang on, and especially if you are promoted, you discover a new kind of pleasure.  you are pleased by the ease with which you can write summaries and bulletins from news agency printouts, by the way you ca judge length.  ending a broadcast on the dot, having everything run smoothly, selecting a running order that makes sense, knowing instinctively what you can and cannot do.  professionalism.
",yeah ?
255,"mummy and i, we were more like lovers, really, or sisters.  then a couple of years after daddy died, and not long after i left oxford, she started seeing various men and i was furious.  i really was upset. i stopped going home.  i never phoned.  i went round telling everyone how awful her books were. and she hardly seemed to notice, and that made me angrier.  then i got a job i was interested in, and i started to see lots of men, and i suppose i grew up a little and began to understand.  so i wrote her a long letter, almost seven pages, saying how sorry i was, and how i was worried that we were drifting apart.  and do you know, she wrote me a poem, a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters.
","well , if the bugs are up up , you are the best , and the heat , and the things things are up ."
256,"damn.  they are early.
