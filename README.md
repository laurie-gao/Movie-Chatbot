## Introduction

This project is an experiment in sequence to sequence natural language processing with an aim of building a chatbot model capable of conversing in a human-like manner. To make a state-of-the-art chatbot used by services today, a substantially larger dataset and superior hardware would be required. Therefore, the focus of this project is not to build a robust chatbot, but to test whether the model can pick up patterns in speech and give reasonable responses with limited data and training time. 

Sample results outputed by model:

## Data preprocessing

The training data is obtained from the [cornell movie dialogs corpus](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html)

1. Run parse_data.py to convert the raw data into train_data.csv
2. 

## Model architechture

The code for the entire model can be found in Model.py. The main building blocks of the model are listed below:

#### Embedding Layer

#### Encoder

#### Attention

#### Decoder
