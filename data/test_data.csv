"betty, this is margo west. she wants to meet you. miss mayfield.
",
"i think i would like to dance.
",
"please be a little more careful how you talk, mr. mitchell.
",
"i think you are drunk.
",
"what is the matter, baby? don't you like being kissed?
",
"good evening, miss.
",
"they might think i was running away from something.
",
"good morning. can i do something for you?
",
"you can have the table yourself, if you would rather. i am only killing time.
",
"your liquor laws..
",
"a fellow named brandon has a penthouse here. he is holding open house. i was up there. too noisy. bored.
",
"you are not paying for this. it's quite enough that you let me sit at your table.
",
"neatly said...but to the wrong man. the trouble with pretty girls is that they cannot imagine anyone thinking of anything else but the fact they are pretty girls. i get tired of it.
",
"dance?
",
"i know it's a littler late for an apology.
",
"you said it wasn't a tragedy.
",
"there isn't one.. that anyone would believe. i went for a walk after dinner, down to the ocean...alone... i came up and went to bed. i didn't sleep very well. then there was a thunderstorm. and it began to rain. i went across to close the french door. that is the first time i saw him out there.
",
"no. and i have never fired a gun in my life, aren't you supposed not to touch it?
",
"they will know whether he killed himself.
",
"go ahead...if you want to. it doesn't matter.
",
"you tried to run away.
",
"want a spike in it?
",
"there's one thing i may as well tell you. you will find it out anyhow. i tried to run awaywhen i found him out there on the balcony. there wasn't any plane.
",
"bad?
",
"what time is it?
",
"cold?
",
"want to dance?
",
"that man over there. he was in the hotel lobby.
",
"quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby?
",
"he is a fellow with a very hard knee, and he knows how to use it.
",
"it still doesn't matter if i kiss you?
",
"that is the second round i have lost tonight.  that fellow hurt me.
",
"it sounds like a fair location. could you be a little more exact?
",
"cant be too close for me.  right across the street from it suits me.  anything else listed?
",
"i hated to go to that place.  i almost went to the police station instead.
",
"if you meant it, you wouldn't show it to me, betty.  or am i supposed to deliver it to dear inspector killaine?
",
"take me where i haven't the courage to take myself.
",
"this is the ace, betty.  but not of spades.  they will find out about the other.  they might know already. and when they get this  what would they look for?  where? out there somewhere? 
",
"you will be safe here.  i will not be long.  help yourself to anything you want. the galley's through there.  you can make coffee if you like.
",
"i would still go througheven if i ended up in jail.
",
"well?
",
"killaine's wise.  we cannot wait any longer.  here, put this on.  but stay out of sight until we clear the harbor.  i will tell you when. 
",
"see anything?
",
"cold?
",
"i decided i didn't want a drink...i am beginning to wonder.
",
"funny, i never thought of you that way.  you were so close too.  we were all pretty stupid about you.
",
"in a way.
",
"it buys things, just like any other kind.
",
"you will never make it.  you have out smarted yourself.
",
"it wasn't the time or place.  don't worry about the note, baby.  i am playing for my neck now.
",
"this is it, betty.  they will find us again, fog or no fog.
",
"i think you mean that.
",
"yes, miss.
",
"mrs. west is a very emotional woman.
",
"please answer my question.
",
"well, that is not getting us anywhere. you will not tell me who you are, or give any account of yourself. you will not even give me your address in the united states. why? unhappy marriage?
",
"your family coat of arms, mr. killaine?
",
"what this?
",
"an unhappy marriage hardly seems a sufficient reason for that.
",
"good morning, mr. killaine. i am sorry i cannot give you the name of my bankbecause i have no bank at the moment.  that was a crude trick.
",
"care for a stroll outside? beautiful morning. the air is like wine, the sky is a deep blue.
",
"florida?
",
"down below's stanley park. on the other side of the trees, there's a beach. you can see it.  steveston's over there. coast guard station.  there's the yacht club, and beyond it, the docks. the over on the other side of the inlet, there's grouse mountain. it's about 4000 feet high. there's a restaurant on top of it. very nice restaurant.  i am sorry we couldn't have met in pleasanter circumstances, miss mayfield.",
"i will find out, you know. perhaps not todayperhaps not tomorrow. but in the end, i will find out.
",
"i wouldn't make you talk about it. my job is the death of marry mitchell.  why cannot you give me your confidence?
",
"you will not tell me who you are? you will not even give me a chance to help you?
",
"this isn't a very good place to talk.
",
"i expected nothing else.
",
"i am about to be very silly.  a man passes a girl on the streeta very lovely girlhis eyes meet her eyes, and something reaches out and takes hold of his heart and then she goes on and is lost in the crowdand he says to himself, there goes my lost love and it's trueif he never sees her again, it's still true.  of course, after a while, he forgets or almost forgetsbecause after a while we forget almost everything.  but this man is a copper.  he gets ordersroutine ordersto go to a place and investigate a murder and everything points to a certain girl.
",
"you have got a couple of hours, maybe.
",
"what are you going to dotoss your job into puget sound?  because i make you think of magnolias?  i thought policeman was something like a soldier.  that his duty came first.  however much he might happen hate it.
",
"he could have killed me a dozen times.  you would never have known.
",
"but i tell youif you would only understand.
",
"good morning, mr. brandon.
",
"mr. reed, please, for mr.  brandon.  very well. have him call. mr. brandon is in his office now.  mr. reed stepped out, mr.  brandon.
",
"i would like a few words with you, in private.
",
"nice friendly approach you have got. goble. i could hardly walk when i got out of bed this morning.
",
"private eye?
",
"that is a nice hard knee you have got, goble. how would you like to trade it for a broken neck?
",
"you hurt my feelings. i ought to raise the price to be a thousand.
",
"there's two hundred. i will meet you in an hourwhere we met last night
",
"hi margo. hello killaine. you two come together?
",
"let me introduce you. mr.  killaine, mrs. west.
",
"what will you have, margo?
",
"you make friends quickly, don't you, clark?
",
"i am sorry. this thing has just knocked me silly.  how long do we have to wait for this police character?
",
"all right, let's see the buzzer.
",
"how are your teeth getting along?
",
"what is this in favor of?
",
"what?
",
"it goes with this... cold houses and warm drinks...the effete englishman.
",
"that is what i like about cocktail parties. everyone is so perfectly natural.
",
"would it have helped if i would knocked him down?
",
"thank you.
",
"where?
",
"could be.
",
"it was lying where on the balcony?
",
"how about a cup of coffee?
",
"how are you two getting along?
",
"in case you want to have us followed.
",
"time for a little chat?
",
"thanks.  lovely view you have, haven't you?
",
"and old man clarendon?  he had a motive, too.  margo and her money.
",
"mitchell was too drunk.
",
"no more for me, thanks.  remember what i said.  i cannot interfere with the law.
",
"you forgetting the gag line, killaine.  the police don't take anything for granted.
",
"you do a lot of real estate trading, brandon?
",
"i had a father who knew how to steal.
",
"hello, mitchell. having fun?
",
"what is the matter, baby. don't you like me anymore?
",
"do me a favor, mitchell. find yourself a nice secluded park bench.
",
"good afternoon, mr. campbell.
",
"i think we would better discuss this in my office, mr. mitchell.
",
"i am getting positively haggard. in a couple of years people will be describing me as well preserved.
",
"so much less refined than frizzling them in the chair.
",
"what are you doing here?
",
"i am a very observant man. you had something in your bag this afternoon, something that causes you to hold it in a particular way. something that made a particular sound when you put it down on the bar. you went out with mitchell. none of us ever saw him again.
",
"one of these days, you are going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you have cut your throat.
",
"mr. clarendon, have you ever seen this before?
",
"i needn't keep you any longer, mr. clarendon.
",
"the harbor police have just picked up a dead man out of the water.
",
"and don't get too logical, driscoll. in police business it doesn't work. i wish it did.  but it doesn't
",
"got a moment, inspector?
",
"we have done that.  he is a san francisco private eye.  name martin j. goble, goble.  had initials in his hat and for once he lived where he bought it.  goble and greer is the firm name.
",
"catch me at the vancouver royal if it's important.
",
"the super's just given me the sweetest dressing down i have ever had.  i am still reeling from it. and believe me, i had it coming. i apologize.  what you think is importanti think is important.
",
"what is the face for, driscoll?
",
"i am looking for mr. brandon.
",
"i have an appointment with him, right here, right now.
",
"mr. brandon couldn't be here.  he might have left something for you. what would it look like?
",
"i need a receipt.  sign your name across the flap.
",
"you in charge here?
",
"i knew him. he was easy to dislike, poor chap.
",
"... i supposed you knew her, too, inspector.
",
"pearlhandled .25 automatic, uh?  no, it's a belgian gun... 6.6 mm.",
"this make of gun throws a shell backwards, high, and to the right. the chaise is only about four feet from the wall.
",
"she didn't seem the type to lam outeven if she got the chance. that stuff was all gone through last night.  anything special you are looking for, inspector?
",
"g.g. market oneeightfourtwo.
",
"that is pretty risky business, inspector.
",
"not too hard, is it?
",
"was that about the right angle?
",
"you have got a dead man on your hands. you killed jimeven if it wasn't murder.  what are you going to do about it?
",
"this is the shell.  what about the gun?
",
"how did he know he would get the chance? he couldn't have arranged it.
",
"greer and goble in the call building, san francisco.  just like you thought...two murders in two days.  different places, different methods, different people. nothing connects them, but a telephone number.
",
"oh, the coldstream guards.  don't you take your hat off in elevators?
",
"may you what?
",
"scotch and plain water, i think.
",
"i never saw it before.
",
"what about me?
",
"you knew mitchell pretty well, didn't you, mrs. west?
",
"remember that time, didn't i? good morning mrs. west.  does your visit here mean you have changed your mind?
",
"you couldn't possible have traced it this soonnot possibly.
",
"yes, i think so.  here are two glazed manila envelopes.  one is the bag type.  the other one had the money in it.  don't ask me how i know.  i know.
",
"no doubt about that one.
",
"you will have to take my word for it.  we don't make slides until we have perfect prints for comparison.
",
"this gun permit was issued to clark brandon?
",
"killaine, this is mr. mitchell, senior.  young mitchell's father. he just flew in from toronto.
",
"i have explained the situation to mr. mitchell up to a point.  now about this mayfield girl?
",
"no.
",
"am i to interpret that as an order to arrest miss mayfield?
",
"are you a policeman or a softheaded nincompoop?
",
"this girl is a murderess, killaine.
",
"superintendent j. mckechnie, vancouver police department. vancouver b.c. replaying to your e.p. teletype classification no. 2684 incomplete.  we advise identification possible.  elizabeth kinsolving, arrested greenwater, north carolina, january 8, 1948, on a charge of murder.  signed, fbi., washington, d.c. h. cleary, inspector in charge.  have ye any comment, killaine?",

"i believe you won decorations during the war.
",
"there are people in this world who don't think a police badge is a badge of honor.  i am not one of them.
",
"get out of here!
",
"i am afraid you are not very glad to see me, margo.
",
"i hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared. i wasn't lucky.
",
"what will we do about it, margo?
",
"i have always been a heel. i guess i always will be.
",
"i seem to remember that you like to help yourself.
",
"what is this?
",
"i am sorry. i forgot about calling for you.
",
"she is beautiful. and young.  no thank you.
",
"you are very attractive, my dear. and you look very unsophisticated.
",
"mr. penfield.  i am sorry to have kept you.
",
"he is a little unhappy.  i hope he wasn't a nuisance?
",
"my first husband worked for the bbc.  i doubt if anyone there remembers him now, just another long dead diligent administrator. he would have been useful in the fight to preserve the bbc's independence during the suez crisis  one of the few things he was passionate about.  i became involved too.  i started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of suez. then he died, and i loots the will to write it.  by the time i was over his death, other books had been published, and it wasn't worth going on.
",
"my husband apologises for not joining us.  it's not too cold for you, mr. penfield?
",
"to ann.
",
"here i am lecturing you.  have some pt.
",
"so i can go ahead and be a historian without feeling like a poseur.i shall be fulfilling a citizen's duty.
",
"i do worry about susan.  have you known her long?  she hasn't mentioned you.
",
"thank you.
",
"the references are to hansard or to newspapers.  i haven't got the actual speeches now.  you will have to chase them up.
",
"hello.  anyone for a walk?  tom isn't, i can tell you.
",
"shall we go?
",
"then i began to listen to what the welloff were saying about the poor now  the war had just ended, and the language was much the same as it had been before the first reform act.  a small minority thought that england was really theirs, they had made it, they owned it.  the rest, the wage earners, were foreigners, outsiders intent on wrecking it all.
",
"thank you.
",
"now first of all, tell us your name.
",
"but i am not an interviewer or a correspondent.
",
"give them here.  this tells you how the women's peace camp came to be set up.  all local women at first, then we had support from women and men all over the country.
",
"terrific.
",
"charles!  i didn't know you were back.  have a good holiday?
",
"how's mary?
",
"aha.  james giving some woman the old heaveho.
",
"it's terribly good.
",
"committed to memory.  forever.
",
"attributed?
",
"congratulations.  who with?
",
"i know, i know!  gentlemen, let me introduce you to one of our most talented contributors to the cold war.  james penfield.  he wrote the opening chapter, on 'the berlin airlift'.  one of the best chapters in the book.
",
"would you like a dessert...i am having one.
",
"yes...you are not a socialist then?
",
"personally james, i am very excited by this new arrangement we have. it gives us direct access to literally hundreds of american collages.  twentieth century history is a growth area over there, don't ask me why.  your readership will be first and second year american collage students...
",
"james... i cannot begin to tell you how pleased we all are.  congratulations, and i really mean it.
",
"so it's all worked out perfectly...
",
"was that your chapter, then?  it was very good.
",
"can i give you a lift?
",
"what did you think of that wadja film?
",
"everyone describes the same process. at first it is exciting.  you are at the centre of the world.  as soon as anything happens, you are the first to know about it.  and there are deadlines a dozen times a day, even more, and that is intimidating and exciting.  then you get the hang of it and the excitement wears off.  your a clerk in a rather dowdy office.  there's none of the glamour of television, or the penetration of serious journalism.  you are a processor of semiofficial news.  some people leave at this stage.  then, if you hang on, and especially if you are promoted, you discover a new kind of pleasure.  you are pleased by the ease with which you can write summaries and bulletins from news agency printouts, by the way you ca judge length.  ending a broadcast on the dot, having everything run smoothly, selecting a running order that makes sense, knowing instinctively what you can and cannot do.  professionalism.
",
"mummy and i, we were more like lovers, really, or sisters.  then a couple of years after daddy died, and not long after i left oxford, she started seeing various men and i was furious.  i really was upset. i stopped going home.  i never phoned.  i went round telling everyone how awful her books were. and she hardly seemed to notice, and that made me angrier.  then i got a job i was interested in, and i started to see lots of men, and i suppose i grew up a little and began to understand.  so i wrote her a long letter, almost seven pages, saying how sorry i was, and how i was worried that we were drifting apart.  and do you know, she wrote me a poem, a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters.
",
"damn.  they are early.
",
"again?
",
"why not stay?
",
"you don't trust me.
",
"i might see you in norfolk over the weekend.
",
"i think we are ready now, thank you.  and how was norfolk?  did you get on with my mother?
",
"do you think she is invited you up for her sake or for mine?
",
"i haven't seen much of you.
",
"look, will you come on a walk with me tomorrow?
",
"might?
",
"jeremy phoned this morning
",
"shall we have a drink or something?
",
"we don't seem to get much time to talk.
",
"not here.
",
"blas and epicene.
",
"c'mon.  i don't want any jones about this.
",
"bastard.
",
"to the fleet.
",
"now, top secret file.
",
"uhhuh.  tell me what you think of this first.
",
"she is never written a book in it, but she clearly knew a lot.
",
"that is enough of that.
",
"what have you been up to?
",
"fortunate that i was here to keep susan entertained.
",
"perhaps i will, then.
",
"still in love?
",
"six onion bajees!  great girl.  did you shake the mother off?
",
"susan and i are very old friends, james.
",
"hello.
",
"what period?
",
"wait...and with talks at the united nations still making little progress, tension and anxiety settled on mps of all parties in westminster.  speaking on the jimmy young show earlier today, mrs thatcher said the prospects of a peaceful solution did not look encouraging.  what is it?
",
"not bad.
",
"it's that lady from norfolk again.
",
"hello, jimmy.
",
"so how is she?
",
"everyone's been marvellous really, jimmy.  the neighbours come and sit with her while i am at work.
",
"i have got to be going.  i have got a meeting tonight.
",
"i just might give you a ring when we get back to london.  there's one or two things i would like to... will you let me have your number before you leave?  have you ever watched a commercial being made?
",
"i will tell you another thing.  we might have led the world once into the industrial revolution, now we lead with television commercials. we are the best, it's as simple as that.  even the americans will admit it now ... the camera work, the acting, the scripts, special effects.  we have got the lot.  nearly all the good directors here have ambitions to make serious films.  that food you are eating.
",
"susan told me that your visits to norfolk had ... well, an ulterior motive.
",
"jeremy!  how fantastic.
",
"it was last year.
",
"darling susan.  you look like an angel.  but where is your hat?
",
"don't point it at james!
",
"what have you got there?
",
"we will see what we can do.
",
"it was incredible.  he came back, made a pompous little bow and said, 'my dear girl you may film me all afternoon if you wish.' and he is promised not to talk to the press.
",
"don't close the door.  don't turn out the hall light.
",
"ah, susy, it...
",
"don't you want to walk, tom?
",
"something happened.  you got nuked in the last quarter.
",
"friends of yours, huh?
",
"gonna be some people at my house tonight.  maybe you can make it.
",
"don't you gamble?
",
"so what is the biggest?  waimea?
",
"i gotta be fucking crazy.
",
"football's a manmade game.  you keep score with numbers.  but in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent.  just you and the wave.
",
"how you figure?
",
"one shot stopping.
",
"ever done this before?
",
"it's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer.  one last speedstar.
",
"we gonna jump or jerk off?
",
"utah, you copy bruddah?
",
"you gonna pull?
",
"don't screw around man, pull it!
",
"what is this?
",
"you are a fucking dead man
",
"talk.
",
"you call him... right now... and tell him to let her go.
",
"we are wasting time.
",
"i cannot do this.
",
"i am not armed.
",
"where is roach?
",
"why should i?
",
"pretty radical, johnny.  even for you.  why don't you pull it?
",
"go on, johnny.  pull it.  but you gotta drop the gun, first!  right?! you use your other hand what you gonna hold on with?
",
"three seconds... two... one...
",
"wild ride, huh?
",
"and i always knew i could count on you, agent utah.
",
"yeah?  what?
",
"you sure he isn't out back?  you mind if i go take a look?
",
"you know less than nothing.  if you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't.
",
"eating solid breakfasts, utah?
",
"this is us.  bank robbery.  and you are in the bankrobbery capital of the world
",
"you are a real blueflame special, aren't you, utah?  i don't know why they sent you to la.  must be an asshole shortage.
",
"how was the beach?
",
"special agent utah, this is not some job flippin' burgers at the drivein. yes, the surfboard bothers me.  yes, your approach to this case bothers me.  and yes, you bother me.  you two have produced squat in the last two weeks, during which time the ex presidents have robbed two more banks!!  do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me?
",
"three men dead.  one of them a cop. how's that sit in your gut, utah?
",
"they found the drop car up on mulholland.  i want you two to go work it.
",
"cole and munoz?  i been on this case for two years.
",
"look, harp.  don't turn him over to the uniforms like some punk.  let me ride him in.
",
"harp, let me tell you something.  i was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass, and you know one thing i learned in all those years that you still haven't?
",
"added to which indignity, i got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blueflamer fresh out of quantico for a partner. some quarterback punk, johnny unitas or something.
",
"pappas.  angelo pappas.
",
"good move.
",
"they don't go for the vault?
",
"surgical.  look at them separate the dye packs.  dick and ronny know their jobs.
",
"you through, mr. wizard?  let me know if you find jimmy hoffa under the seat while you are at it.  hell, it's only 730.  the night's still young... you can solve this case and start on another one.",
"sorry.
",
"oh well he must be a surfer.
",
"candle wax.  car wax.  mustache wax? could be anything.  guy's waxing his mustache at the beach.  gets sand in it.  wipes it off with a shoe.  shoe scuffs the counter.
",
"sex wax?  you are not into kinky shit, are you angelo?
",
"... four months.  june to october. mmmm...same the year before.
",
"johnny, it's the only way.
",
"they are like some kind of tribe. got their own language.  you cannot just walk up to these guys.  you have got to get out there.  learn some moves.  get into their head.  pick up the speech.
",
"i think you gotta hit them straight on!
",
"what, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car?
",
"angelo, pay attention.  there's gonna be a test afterward.  lab is showing traces of toxins.  pcbs. heavy elements... selenium, titanium and arsenic.
",
"the beaches are always being closed because of waste spills, right?  and surfers are territorial.  they stick mostly to certain breaks.  if we can get some hair samples, and get a match to a certain beach, we would know which break the expresidents surf. you buyin' this?
",
"big zippo so far.  how about you?
",
"no, but there are four guys back there you might check out.
",
"look, if you are gonna go leavin' your piece and your shield in the car, you can damn well stay in sight.  okay?
",
"... felony b and e, three months in juvey.  better.  felony assault. postgraduate work at chino. excellent.  i am lovin' it.  what about the brother?  great!  another model citizen. these guys really fit the profile.
",
"when did harp say they would have the warrant?
",
"did that worthless punk partner of mine ever show up?
",
"i am ready to rock, angelo.  where you want me?
",
"aw shit.
",
"johnny!  uh, you, uh... should call first, you know?  hey, where the hell were you all day?  you gotta at least call in or something.  you okay?
",
"... so i started tailing him.
",
"they are on their way to maui.
",
"i say we call it in.  get some backup.  but you gotta do it.  harp will not listen to me.
",
"time for lunch.
",
"the hell are they?!
",
"nothing?
",
"i know where they are going.
",
"angelo!  don't fire!
",
"what do you want?
",
"what is it?  you all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing? this is a line, right?
",
"i came out here from ohio a month ago.  never saw the ocean before.  i didn't think it would effect me so much.  like i am drawn to it, or something.  i want to do what you do.  it's the truth.
",
"stop here.  do you agree to do exactly what i say when i say it?
",
"nice place.
",
"who's the girl?
",
"bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. i hope you are not buying into this banzaibullshit like the rest of bodhi's moonies.
",
"what is goin' on?
",
"i can barely do this in broad daylight.
",
"you had enough?
",
"look at you.
",
"those are cold.
",
"i... i gotta go.
",
"ouch.
",
"so what would the other guy look like?
",
"jesus christ, johnny  you have been using me!  your jacket's on the floor in the bathroom  this goddamn thing's half out of the pocket... oh god, it's all part of some case, isn't it?
",
"i work bank robbery.  guys i am after are surfers.  i needed you, at first, but not
",
"well, i saw you and
",
"hey!  uh, how do i get back in?
",
"bye.
",
"major, looks like there were ten, maybe twelve guerrillas. looks like they took some prisoners from the chopper.  then a different set of track, over there.
",
"strange, major. there was a firefight. shooting in all directions.
",
"billy... what the hell's wrong with you?
",
"you have been pushing too many pencils, dillon. had enough?
",
"that piece of work you guys pulled off at the berlin embassy last week was really something. blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat. beautiful.
",
"wasn't my style. we are a rescue unit, not assassins.  this must be good. big shot from the cia, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. what is so important?
",
"our rendezvous points and radio freqs. are indicated and fixed. awacs contact on four hour intervals.
",
"you don't know how much i missed this, dutch!!! once you get this in your blood, you never get it out!!!
",
"billy's on it.  heat seeker. pretty sophisticated for halfasses mountain boys.
",
"mean anything to you?
",
"i knew this man. green berets, out of fort bragg. what the hell were they doing in here? you got any answers for this, dillon?
",
"it was all bullshit. all of it. from the start... you set us up, got us in here to do your dirty work.
",
"she is too valuable. she is got to know their whole network. the whole set up. we take her with us.
",
"blain...  ... just like the others... no powder burns, no shrapnel.
",
"we are still too far in, they will not risk coming in for us.
",
"you are wastin' your time.
",
"what the hell do you think you are doing?
",
"he will be looking for the trip wires. if we are lucky, he will not see this.
",
"no way, dutch. i am going. you get these people and get the hell out of here.
",
"i will see you there.
",
"thanks.
",
"don't know, only saw one of 'em. camouflaged. he was there...  ... those fucking eyes...
",
"take a position over there. i will work around towards you. when i flush him, you nail him...
",
"any sign of the hostages?
",
"what is got billy so spooked?
",
"you saw what?
",
"put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back. we will bury him in the morning.
",
"we have got most of the flares, frags. and two claymores just outside. nothin's comin' close to here without trippin' on somethin'.
",
"i am sorry, bull. it's never easy. he was a good soldier.
",
"you are looking well, dutch.
",
"that is over the border, general.
",
"what have you got in mind, general.
",
"you lift off in three hours.  there's one other thing.

"took 'em out with a heat seeker.
",
"what is he got?
",
"major, you would better take a look at this.
",
"what in god's name...?
",
"how could anyone get through this, carry blain out, right under our noses without leavin' a trace?
",
"georgia.
",
"your uncle will like this.
",
"mr. harris, we know you have purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  we also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.
",
"we are on the verge of closing a large navy contract.  double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares.  we would give you a promissory note...
",
"there's no way you could know that.
",
"we can reach an understanding on this.
",
"i like your hat.
",
"hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet?  i am.  this is vivian.  you two been together long?  you and edward?
",
"it's... it's not like that.

"you don't know anything about me.
",
"what is that long building over there?
",
"the real estate possibilities are endless.  most of the yard we will just level.  i talked to a couple of developers, under the table, of course, and they said 
",
"congratulations, sir.
",
"who are you going after next, sir?
",
"what would it take to buy our stock back?  name your price.
",
"mr. kross, i am not here to sell you my stock.  on the contrary, i am here to buy yours.
",
"mr. harris.
",
"yes.  i am here to tell you that i have reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer.
",
"stop.  for just a moment.  mr. kross, i would like to ask you a few questions ubeforeu you sign. you realize that you are a target. if you weren't mine, you would be someone elses, correct?
